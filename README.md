# Retail Sales Trial Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of a targeted intervention in selected retail stores to improve sales performance and customer engagement. The analysis compares trial stores, where the intervention was implemented, with control stores, to determine the effectiveness of the strategy. The results from the trial provide actionable insights into customer behavior and sales trends, with the goal of scaling the approach to other stores.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to:

1.Measure the effectiveness of a marketing or operational intervention in increasing sales and customer transactions.
2.Compare the performance of trial stores with control stores to ensure the observed changes were due to the intervention and not external factors.
3. Provide insights into customer segmentation, identifying the impact on different customer groups (e.g., premium vs. mainstream customers).

## Data
The dataset consists of:

Transaction Data: A total of 246,742 transactions from multiple stores, covering key details like product name, quantity sold, total sales, and customer segmentation.
Customer Segmentation Data: Insights from 72,637 loyalty customers, classified by lifestyle stage and spending behavior (premium or mainstream).
Store Sales Data: Monthly sales and transaction details for the trial and control stores.

## Key Analyses
Store Selection: Two stores, Store 77 and Store 86, were selected as trial stores, with closely matched Store 226 and Store 82 as control stores for comparison.
Performance Comparison: Key metrics such as total sales, number of customers, and transactions per customer were compared between trial and control stores over a defined period.
Sales Impact: The trial stores showed significant improvement, with Store 77 achieving a 7.47% increase in sales compared to its control store.
Customer Insights: Segmentation revealed that premium customers contributed more to the increase in sales, while mainstream customers were more price-sensitive.

## Results
The intervention led to an overall increase in sales and customer transactions in the trial stores.
Store 77 and Store 86 outperformed their control stores, with notable improvements in sales performance during the trial period.
Based on these findings, the intervention can be scaled to other stores with similar customer profiles.

## Technologies Used
Python for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for detailed exploratory data analysis
Statistical Analysis to measure the impact of the intervention, including correlation and magnitude distance calculations
